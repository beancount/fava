      A double-entry accounting system that uses text files as input.

      Beancount defines a simple data format or "language" that lets you define
      financial transaction records in a text file, load them in memory and
      generate and export a variety of reports, such as balance sheets or income
      statements. It also provides a client with an SQL-like query language to
      filter and aggregate financial data, and a web interface which renders
      those reports to HTML. Finally, it provides the scaffolding required to
      automate the conversion of external data into one's input file in
      Beancount syntax.
