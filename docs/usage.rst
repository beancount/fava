Getting Started
===============

If you're new to Beancount or double-entry accounting in general, we
recommend `Command-line Accounting in Context
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4Vz3wZB_8-ZcAwIFde8X5CjzKshE4-OXtVVHm4RQ8s/>`_,
a motivational document written by Martin Blais, the author of Beancount.

To learn how to create your beancount file, refer to `Getting Started with
Beancount
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5At-z1sP8rgwYLHso5sEy3u4rMnIUDDgob9Y_BYuWE/>`_
guide. Martin Blais has written a great deal of very detailed documentation for
Beancount, see the `Beancount Documentation
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaondTJCS_IUPBHFNdT8oqFKJjVJDsfsn6JEjBG04eA>`_
page for an index of the available documentation.
