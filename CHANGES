Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

The `conversion` and `interval` options have been removed. Their functionality
can be achieved with the new `default-page` option.

v1.18 (2021-01-16)
------------------

This release contains couple of small improvements and various bug fixes.

v1.17 (2020-11-15)
------------------

This release adds a document preview to the import page, as well as support
for Python 3.9. It also fixes a couple of bugs.

v1.16 (2020-10-18)
------------------

This release brings area charts as an alternative option to view the various
line charts in Fava and a Catalan translation for Fava. There is also now an
option to set the indentation of inserted Beancount entries. As usual this
release also includes various minor fixes and improvements.

v1.15 (2020-05-30)
------------------

This release accumulates various minor fixes and improvements, for example the
setting of filters from payees and metadata in the Journal report.

v1.14 (2020-02-16)
------------------

This is mainly a bugfix release to fix compatibility with one of the main
dependencies (werkzeug). Also, a `default-conversion` option was added, which
allows setting a default conversion.

v1.13 (2020-02-01)
------------------

Fava can now display charts for BQL queries - if they have exactly two columns
with the first being a date or string and the second an inventory, then a line
chart or treemap chart is shown on the query page.

v1.12 (2019-12-03)
------------------

Apart from plenty of bug fixes, this release mainly contains improvements to
the forms to add transactions: postings can now be dragged and the full cost
syntax of Beancount should supported.

v1.11 (2019-08-20)
------------------

The import page of Fava has been reworked - it now supports moving files to the
documents folder and the import process should be a bit more interactive. This
release also contains various fixes and a new `collapse-pattern` option to
collapse accounts in account trees based on regular expressions (and replaces
the use of the `fava-collapse-account` metadata entry).

Other changes:

- Command line flags can be specified by setting environment variables.
- A Taiwanese translation has been added.

v1.10 (2019-01-31)
------------------

This release contains mostly smaller changes and fixes. In particular, the net
worth chart will now follow the selected conversion.

v1.9 (2018-10-08)
-----------------

In this release, the click behaviour has been updated to allow filtering for
payees. The entry input forms now allow inputting prices and costs.  As
always, bugs have been fixed.

v1.8 (2018-07-25)
-----------------

The journal design has been updated and should now have a clearer structure.
Starting with this version, there will not be any more GUI releases of Fava.
The GUI broke frequently and does not seem to worth the maintenance burden.

Other changes:

- When downloading documents, the original filename will be used.
- `any()` and `all()` functions have been added to the filter syntax to allow
  filtering entries by properties of their postings.
- As always, bugs have been fixed.

v1.7 (2018-03-09)
-----------------

The entry filters have been reworked in this release and should now support for
more flexible filtering of the entries. See the help page on how the new syntax
works.  Also, when completing the payee in the transaction form, the postings
of the last transaction for this payee will be auto-filled.

Other changes:

- The fava-option to hide the charts has been removed. This is now tracked in
  the page URL.
- As always, bugs have been fixed.

v1.6 (2017-10-06)
-----------------

This is a release with various small changes and mainly some speed
improvements to the Balance Sheet and the net worth calculation. Also, if 'At
Value' is selected, the current unrealized gain is shown in parentheses in the
Balance Sheet.

Other changes:

- The currently filtered entries can now be exported from the Journal page.
- The CLI now has a ``--version`` flag.

v1.5 (2017-07-23)
-----------------

Fava now has an interface to edit single entries. Clicking on the entry date in
the Journal will open an overlay that shows the entry context and allows
editing just the lines of that entry.

Other changes:

- The source editor now has a menu that gives access to editor commands like
  "fold all".
- Entries with matching tags or links can now be excluded with ``-#tag``.
- The keyboard shortcuts are now displayed in-place.
- The ``incognito`` option has been removed and replaced with a ``--incognito``
  command line switch.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

v1.4 (2017-05-14)
-----------------

Fava now provides an interface for Beancount's import system that allows you to
import transactions from your bank for example.

Fava can now show your balances at market value or convert them to a single
currency if your file contains the necessary price information.

We now also provide a compiled GUI version of Fava for Linux and macOS. This
version might still be a bit buggy so any feedback/help on it is very welcome.

Other changes:

- The ``insert-entry`` option can be used to control where transactions are
  inserted.
- The transaction form now accepts tags and links in the narration field.
- Budgets are now accumulated over all children where appropriate.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`TZdyrski` and :user:`Akuukis` for their contributions.

v1.3 (2017-03-15)
-----------------

The translations of Fava are now on `POEditor.com
<https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=90283>`__, which has helped us get
translations in five more languages: Chinese (simplified), Dutch, French,
Portuguese, and Spanish. A big thank you to the new translators!

The transaction form has been improved, it now supports adding metadata and the
suggestions will be ranked by how often and recently they occur (using
exponential decay).

The Query page supports all commands of the ``bean-query`` shell and shares its
history of recently used queries.

Fava has gained a basic extension mechanism. Extensions allow you to run hooks
at various points, e.g., after adding a transaction. They are specified using
the ``extensions`` option and for an example, see the ``fava.ext.auto_commit``
extension.

Other changes:

- The default sort order in journals has been reversed so that the most recent
  entries come first.
- The new ``incognito`` option can be used to obscure all numbers.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`johannesharms` and :user:`xentac` for their contributions.

v1.2 (2016-12-25)
-----------------

You can now add transactions from within Fava. The form supports autocompletion
for most fields.

Fava will now show a little bubble in the sidebar for the number of events in
the next week. This can be configured with the ``upcoming-events`` option.

Other changes:

- The payee filter can filter by regular expression.
- The tag filter can filter for links, too.
- There's a nice spinning indicator during asynchronous page loads.
- The Journal shows little indicators for metadata.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`fokusov` for their contributions.

v1.1 (2016-11-19)
-----------------

You can now upload documents by dropping them onto transactions, which will
also add the file path as `statement` metadata to the transaction. Fava also
ships with a plugin to link these transactions with the generated documents.
See the help pages for details.

This is the first release for which we provide compiled binaries (for macOS and
Linux). These do not have any dependencies and can simply be executed from the
terminal.

Other changes:

- The bar charts on account pages now also show budgets.
- The Journal can now be sorted by date, flag and narration.
- Fava now has a Russian translation, thanks to :user:`fokusov`.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`adamgibbins` and :user:`xentac` for their contributions.

v1.0 (2016-10-19)
-----------------

This is a major new release that includes too many improvements and changes to
list. Some highlights:

- The layout has been tweaked and we use some nicer fonts.
- Fava looks and works much better on smaller screens.
- Fava loads most pages asynchronously, so navigating Fava is much faster and
  responsive.

Fava's configuration is not read from a configuration file anymore but can
rather be specified using custom entries in the Beancount file. Some options
have also been removed or renamed, so check Fava's help page on the available
options when upgrading from v0.3.0.

There have been many changes under the hood to improve Fava's codebase and a
lot of bugs have been squashed.

:user:`yegle` for their contributions.
