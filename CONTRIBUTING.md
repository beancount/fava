### Reporting bugs and suggestions

Please first search the existing issues, including closed ones, for a report
that matches your issue.

When reporting a bug, provide details of the Fava version and browser used.

If you want to report a security issue, please email mail@jakobschnitzer.de.

### Contributing code

See [here](https://beancount.github.io/fava/development.html) how to setup a
development environment. Make a fork and submit your Pull Request. If it's a
large change or you want some help to get started with coding, open an issue
beforehand to discuss it or just ask about it in the
[chat](https://gitter.im/beancount/fava).

Please contribute tests as well. See the `tests/` subdirectory for existing
tests, which can be run with `make test` (requires `tox`).

### Contributing translations

You can contribute to Fava's translations at the
[Fava project on POEditor.com](https://poeditor.com/join/project/TlraSxOCxt).
All new contributors have to be approved by the maintainers, who do not
automatically get notified, so please send an e-mail/chat on gitter/open an
issue. Translations will be fetched manually by the maintainers from POEditor
for updates.
