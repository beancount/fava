To customize some of Fava's behaviour, you can add custom entries like the
following to your Beancount file.

<pre><textarea is="beancount-textarea">
2016-06-14 custom "fava-option" "default-file"
2016-04-14 custom "fava-option" "auto-reload" "true"
2016-04-14 custom "fava-option" "journal-show" "transaction open"
2016-04-14 custom "fava-option" "currency-column" "100" </textarea></pre>

Below is a list of all possible options for Fava.

---

## `language`

Default: Not set

If this setting is not specified, Fava will try to guess the language from your
browser settings. Fava currently ships translations into the following
languages:

-   Catalan (`ca`)
-   Chinese (`zh_CN` and `zh_TW`)
-   Dutch (`nl`)
-   English (`en`)
-   French (`fr`)
-   German (`de`)
-   Persian (`fa`)
-   Portuguese (`pt`)
-   Russian (`ru`)
-   Slovak (`sk`)
-   Spanish (`es`)
-   Ukrainian (`uk`)

---

## `locale`

Default: Not set or `en` if the Beancount `render_commas` option is set.

This sets the locale that is used to render out numbers. For example, with the
locale `en_IN` the number `1111111.33` will be rendered `11,11,111.33`,
`1,111,111.33` with locale `en`, or `1.111.111,33` with locale `de`.

---

## `default-file`

Use this option to specify a default file for the editor to open. This option
takes no value, the file the custom entry is in will be used as the default. If
this option is not specified, Fava opens the main file by default.

---

## `default-page`

Default: `income_statement/`

Use this option to specify the page to be redirected to when visiting Fava. If
this option is not specified, you are taken to the income statement. You may
also use this option to set filters. For example, a `default-page` of
`balance_sheet/?time=year-2+-+year` would result in you being redirected to a
balance sheet reporting the current year and the two previous years.

Note that the supplied path is relative. It is probably easiest to navigate to
the URL in your browser and copy the portion of the URL after the 'title' of
your beancount file into this option.

---

## `fiscal-year-end`

Default: `12-31`

The last day of the fiscal (financial or tax) period for accounting purposes in
`%m-%d` format. Allows for the use of `FY2018`, `FY2018-Q3`, `fiscal_year` and
`fiscal_quarter` in the time filter, and `FY2018` as the start date, end date,
or both dates in a date range in the time filter.

Examples are:

-   `09-30` - US federal government
-   `06-30` - Australia / NZ
-   `04-05` - UK

See [Fiscal Year on WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year) for
more examples.

---

## `indent`

Default: 2.

The number spaces for indentation.

---

## `insert-entry`

Default: Not set.

This option can be used to specify where entries are inserted. The argument to
this option should be a regular expression matching account names. This option
can be given multiple times. When adding an entry, the account of the entry (for
a transaction, the account of the last posting is used) is matched against all
`insert-entry` options and the entry will be inserted before the datewise latest
of the matching options. If the entry is a Transaction and no `insert-entry`
option matches the account of the last posting the account of the second to last
posting and so on will be tried. If no `insert-entry` option matches or none is
given, the entry will be inserted at the end of the main file.

---

## `auto-reload`

Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to make Fava automatically reload the page whenever a file
changes is detected. By default only a notification is shown which you can click
to reload the page. If the file change is due to user interaction, e.g.,
uploading a document or adding a transaction, Fava will always reload the page
automatically.

---

## `unrealized`

Default: `Unrealized`

The subaccount of the Equity account to post unrealized gains to if the account
trees are shown at market value.

---

## `journal-show`

Default: `transaction balance note document custom budget query`

The entry types and other elements given in this list will be shown in the
Journal report. Supported values are entry type names, as well as well as the
special values "metadata" and "postings" that determine the default visibility
of the corresponding transaction parts.

All other elements will be hidden and can be toggled using the buttons.

---

## `journal-show-transaction`

Default: `cleared pending`

Similarly to the `journal-show` setting, this determines the transaction types
that will be shown in the Journal report. The "transaction types" correspond to
the following transaction flags:

-   `cleared` - `*`
-   `pending` - `!`
-   `other` - All other transaction flags.

---

## `currency-column`

Default: `61`

This option can be used to configure how posting lines are aligned when saved to
file or when using 'Align Amounts' in the editor. Fava tries to align so that
the currencies all occur in the given column. Also, Fava will show a vertical
line before this column in the editor.

---

## `sidebar-show-queries`

Default: `5`

The maximum number of queries to link to in the sidebar. Set this value to `0`
to hide the links altogether.

---

## `upcoming-events`

Default: `7`

Show a notification bubble in the sidebar displaying the number of events less
than `upcoming-events` days away. Set this value to `0` to disable this feature.

---

## `show-closed-accounts`

Default: `false`

## `show-accounts-with-zero-transactions`

Default: `true`

## `show-accounts-with-zero-balance`

Default: `true`

These three options specify which accounts (not) to show in the account trees,
like on the income statement. Accounts with a non-zero balance will always be
shown.

---

## `collapse-pattern`

Default: Not set

This option is used to specify accounts that will be collapsed in the displayed
account trees. The argument to this option is a regular expression matching
account names. This option can be specified multiple times.

Collapsing all accounts below a specific depth in the account tree can be
accomplished by a regex such as: `.*:.*:.*` (this example collapses all accounts
that are three levels deep).

---

## `use-external-editor`

Default: `false`

If `true`, instead of using the internal editor, the `beancount://` URL scheme
is used. See the
[Beancount urlscheme](https://github.com/aumayr/beancount_urlscheme) project for
details.

---

## `account-journal-include-children`

Default: `true`

This determines if the journal in the account report includes entries of
sub-accounts.

---

## `uptodate-indicator-grey-lookback-days`

Default: `60`

If there has been no activity in given number of days since the last balance
entry, then the grey uptodate-indicator is shown.

---

## `import-config`

Default: Not set

Path to a Beancount import configuration file. See the [Import](./import) help
page for details.

---

## `import-dirs`

Default: Not set

Set the directories to be scanned by the Beancount import mechanism.

---

## `invert-income-liabilities-equity`

Default: False

In Beancount the Income, Liabilities and Equity accounts tend to have a negative
balance (see
[Types of Accounts](https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method.html#types-of-accounts)).

This fava options flips the sign of these three accounts in the income statement
and the balance sheet. This way, the net profit chart will show positive numbers
if the income is greater than the expenses for a given timespan.

Note: To keep consistency with the internal accounting of beancount, the journal
and the individual account pages are not affected by this configuration option.
