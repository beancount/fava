With the text inputs at the top right of the page, you can filter the entries
that are displayed in Fava's reports. If you use multiple filters, the entries
matching all of them will be selected.

### Time

Filter entries by their date. You can specify dates and intervals like years,
quarters, months, weeks, and days (for example `2015`, `2012-Q1`, `2010-10`,
`2016-W12`, or `2015-06-12`). You can specify a range of dates like
`2010 - 2012-10` which will display all entries between the start of 2010 and
the end of October 2012.

To refer to dates relative to the current day, you can use the variables `year`,
`quarter`, `month`, `week`, and `day`. These will be substituted with the
current date expressed in the respective format, and support addition and
subtraction. For example you can write `year - day` for all entries in the
current year up to today, or `year-1 - year` for all entries of the last and
current year. To prevent subtraction, use parentheses: `(month)-10` refers to
the 10th of this month, whereas `month-10` would be 10 months ago.

### Account

Filter entries by account, matching any entry this account is part of. The
filter can be an account name, either the full account name or a component of
the account name, or a regular expression matching the account name, e.g.
`.*Company.*` to filter for all that contain `Company`.

### Filter by tag, link, payee and other metadata

This final filter allows you to filter entries by various attributes.

-   Filter by `#tag` or `^link`.
-   Filter by any entry attribute, such as payee `payee:"restaurant"` or
    narration `narration:'Dinner with Joe'`. The argument is a regular
    expression which needs to be quoted (with `'` or `"`) if it contains spaces
    or special characters. If the argument is not a valid regular expression,
    Fava will look for an exact match instead.
-   Search in payee and narration if no specific entry attribute is given, e.g.
    `"Cash withdrawal"`. For Note directives, the comment will be searched.
-   Filter for entries having certain metadata values: `document:"\.pdf$"`. Note
    that if the entry has an attribute of the same name as the metadata key, the
    filter will apply to the entry attribute, not the metadata value.
-   Exclude entries that match a filter by prepending a `-` to it, e.g. `-#tag`
    or `-(^link #tag)`.
-   To match entries by posting attributes, you can use `any()` and `all()`,
    e.g., `any(id:'12', account:"Cash$")` for all entries that have at least one
    posting with metadata `id: 12` or account ending in `Cash`, or
    `all(-account:"^Expenses:Food")` to exclude all transactions having a
    posting to the Expenses:Food account.

These filters can be combined by separating them by spaces to match all entries
satisfying all given filters or by commas to match all entries satisfying at
least one of the given filters. In other words, a space acts like an "and" and a
comma like an "or". As usual, the logical "and" has a higher grouping power than
"or" and you can use parentheses to group filters.

When given regular expressions, Fava checks for a match anywhere in the
corresponding attribute. Matching is always case-insensitive. To find out more
about the specific syntax Fava uses, refer to
[Python's Regular Expression Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=match#regular-expression-syntax).
