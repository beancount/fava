    """Rank a list by exponential decay.

    Maintains scores for the items in a list. We can think of this as the sum
    of all 'likes', where the value of a 'like' starts at 1 and decays
    exponentially. So the current score would be given by (where `t` is the
    current time and `l` is the time of the 'like')

        s = Î£ exp(-RATE * (t - l))

    As only the relative order on the items is relevant, we can multiply all
    scores by exp(RATE * t) and so we need to compute the following
    score:

        s = Î£ exp(RATE * l)

    To avoid huge numbers, we actually compute and store the logarithm of that
    sum.

    Args:
        list_: If given, this list is ranked is by ``.sort()`` otherwise all
            items with at least one 'like' will be ranked.
        rate: This sets the rate of decay. ``1/rate`` will be the time (in
            days) that it takes for the value of a 'like' to decrease by
            ``1/e``. The default rate is set to ``math.log(2) * 1/365`` so
            that a 'like' from a year ago will count half as much as one from
            today.
